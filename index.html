              <h2>ðŸ§¾ Summary of 22 Days - MERN Stack Daily Diary</h2>
              <p>Over the course of 22 days, we started our summer project by building a strong foundation in front-end web development. The first few days were dedicated to learning HTML and CSS, where we understood how to structure a web page, use semantic tags, and style layouts using Flexbox and Grid. We designed simple web pages such as a portfolio and landing page to practice these concepts. After that, we moved on to JavaScript, learning about variables, loops, arrays, functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling. This helped us make web pages interactive and dynamic. We also practiced building small projects like calculators and form validators to strengthen our logic and scripting skills.
              In the second half of the project, we transitioned to modern development using the MERN stack â€” starting with React to create reusable components and manage state efficiently. We then moved to the backend using Node.js and Express.js, learning how to create RESTful APIs and handle server-side logic. Finally, we connected our application to MongoDB, learning how to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently in a NoSQL database. By the end of the 22 days, we were able to integrate all technologies to build a full-stack web application, gaining a clear understanding of how frontend and backend systems interact in real-world projects.
              Would you like me to also give individual day-by-day detailed entries (Day 1-Day 22) after this summary â€” about what exactly you did or learned each day? Itâ€™ll make your diary look more complete for submission.</p>
